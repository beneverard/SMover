## SMover, a jQuery Social Media Plugin

SMover (**S**ocial **M**edia h**over**, pronounced smother) is a jQuery plugin that hides social media icons away, whilst allowing super smooth and easy access to them when required. It's also really small, just 4kb compressed!

SMover hides away social media (in fact, any) icons and only displays them when the user hovers on a call to action, there are no labels with SMover, however the links title is used to signify the links purpose, check out the demo for a hands on session.
